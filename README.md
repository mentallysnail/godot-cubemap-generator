this was made for Godot 4.X+!

after adding "generate_cubemap.gd" to your project, you will be able to add a new child node called "cubemap", simply drag it to whatever you want to generate a cubemap from inside your scene and press on "Bake Cubemap" found within the inspector!
additionally, you're able to specify a save path as well :)

this is most useful to those who are wanting to bake reflectionprobes!
